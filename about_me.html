        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I've been called some variation of Fitch my entire life.  When I actually hear
          the name "Brandon" I sometimes don't even realize I'm being talked to.</p>

          <p>I can't say that I've always had an interest in something for my entire life
          except computers, sports and vehicles with 2 wheels.  I kind of enjoyed doing lots of different activities.  Even did some time with the Suzuki system of violin,
          some piano, clarinet, and drums. My pop introduced us to computers very early.</p>

          <p>He taught me and my older brother how to use Dos very early on.  I'm talking like 6 years old. We could navigate through the system to find what game he installed...
          King's Quest, Zork, Prince of Persia, you name it, we probably played it if it was in that era. And even earlier, there was snake and a few other mini-bit games.</p>

          <p>He also put us on motorcycles even earlier.  Between skateboards, soccer, an attempt
          at basketball, volleyball, and track and field, I've always been doing sports or something active.</p>

          <p>I wouldn't say I'm an outdoorsy person, but I do like to go out and do 'stuff'.</p>

          <p>Since being introduced to programming I feel like majoring in History, almost 10 years ago now,
          was one of the bigger mistakes I've made in my life.  I tell folks that ask me 'why now? why programming?'
          that exact thing.</p>

          <p>I come home and think about new programs I want to write.  I try to finish up homework assignments,
          touch up this page, but it all seems to revolve around what I want to build!</p>

          <p>That's what I think is the best part about programming.  I can be me, the guy who likes to be into all kinds of stuff, but don't necessarily have to learn an entire
          new skill to do it.  Yes, I know there are umpteen languages to learn, but it seems like, at least for me, once I have one down, learning more
          gets easier. Anyway. I love my family, I'm passionate about programming, and can't wait to start building or fixing awesome things.  </p>
