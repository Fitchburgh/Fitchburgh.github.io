I thought the other people in the class would be super excited to make whatever we wanted this week, but it turns out they wanted to catch up on programming books or work in another language… psh! :)
So I came up with an idea to make pokemon fight with beers and based on their weight and the beers iBu and ABV whoever gets drunk faster, loses.  I ran with it.
I started in on the project.  This was going to require all of my skills. Many languages to build this stupid little app that no one will ever see besides me and Bryce.

We were also ‘tasked’ with using workers (sidekiq), a new to us database (redis).  I got my workers working pretty quickly.  I was focused.  Focused on getting something actually presentable by Tuesday.  
Then Friday came.  I was nowhere.  Workers were doing fine, had some spec testing, using file caching, and redis. I hit a wall.  A bug here, a bug there, typos. You name it, I saw it.  I was committed at this point.  I wanted it so badly.  By midnight I had it to a ‘working’ state.  I was printing a pokemon and a brewery to the page in JSON format.  

Saturday.  Kind of a disappointment.  I’m not one to ask for a whole lot of help, but when I needed it, the class was doing other things.  Don’t get me wrong here, I’m not saying what they were doing was wrong.  I just was hoping one other person was going to be available to talk through stuff at the normal ‘Iron Yard’ pace.  
Alas, it was a mostly solo weekend for me.
Here it is, Sunday night at 11:17, and I finally…FINALLY see the scope of a web app.  When the Python-near-grads would say ‘ yeah you find a bug here and a bug there’ it didn’t really dawn on me until I was working on this project…tonight, what that really meant.  

I was typing and doing a manual test of a feature I just ’finished' (yeah, I should probably be using selenium…), and the browser did something strange. I refreshed the page, and it worked properly.  “Oh…that’s a bug” I thought to myself and kept working.  Then I stopped. Opened up a word doc and started writing this post.  

This is what they meant.  This is the scope.  This is an application in ‘full’ scale.  I mean, I have users. I have data storage.  I need multiple pages.  I haven’t even STARTED on the game part yet. For one pre-jr.-dev, this is a shit ton of work.  I really feel like I’m starting to grasp some major backend fundamentals at this point and it makes me happy.  

I’ve been excited about this project since I started it.  I don’t want to sleep but I know tomorrow brings even more challenges.  The good thing about programming, is that you can come back to it.  And hopefully I’ll have more opportunities to see this grow into something I will be proud of.  

I’m so excited to continue working and I hope my classmates and I can remain positive and push forward, because anyone who has taken an iron yard course knows, it’s a hell of a grind sometimes.
