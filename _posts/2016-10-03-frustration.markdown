Frustration.  Start of week 4.  What the heck is Active Record?  How do I use it?
What's the protocol for joining tables?  SQL? Never heard of him. The never ending acronyms in programming never ceases to amaze me.  Luckily enough for me I was raised on acronyms.  More on that another time. So when I'm thrown acronyms I actually remember them, and/or what they are supposed to do.  Vocabulary has never really been an issue for me, and again, luckily, with programming once I hear something I'm usually going to remember at least some of what it does the next time I have to use it.

Frustration, right. So we started using sql and Postgres over the weekend. Our instructor challenged us to research and try out Active Record (we have 0 Rails experience thus far, mind you), or just use OOP and lots of functions and sql syntax.  I took him up on the challenge.  This is the second time this class I've been frustrated to the point of wanting to turn off the laptop, dealing with functions like has_many, and :through to join() some table data.  

I have made some, at least I would consider, friends in the small cohort at TIY, and I was slacking one of them before hanging up the shoes for the evening. She encouraged me to yes, put down the AR work, but pick up something else.  Practice my 57, koans, or read some articles that are backlogging my "programming stuff to read" chrome folder.  Or to write a blog post.  It's good advice, because after cracking open a beer and sitting back down I'm now halfway ready to give AR another try.

Frustration dissipates quickly for me, and I get into tinker mode, stubborn mode, whatever you want to call it, I want to finish.  I want to keep trying.  Talking about a failure makes it less likely to bother me. Just makes me want to conquer it.  

Anyway, it's a beautiful week in Raleigh/Durham and I get to ride the motorcycle to school everyday, where I get to practice my coding skills, and learn more about computer science as a whole.  Nothing to be frustrated about.
