Time. They say 'time is money'.  Coming from sales, I appreciated the sentiment.
Driving in a car for a few hours to meet with a company who could make me 10 grand
was super appealing.  Doing the same drive for a company who could make me 450 bucks
was ... not, super appealing.

I thought I understood 'time is money', then I started The Iron Yard code school.

This is the first time I've ever had debt in my life.  Blessed you could say
with a freak talent of jumping over a stick to grant me passage to a college
degree.  One that served me well in sales, where communication is essential when
dealing with needy folks or coworkers.

I always felt I'd made a serious mistake though.  That is, not starting to seriously
code earlier in life.  At age 12, which seems so long ago, my dad bought me a 'learn to
code C' book.  I dabbled, for a week or so but being 12, I wasn't particularly motivated
to do anything else but ride motorcycles, shoot bb guns, or skateboard.

All that said.  I am sure of it now.  I did make a mistake choosing a liberal arts degree
when I am clearly passionate about programming.

At week 3 of TIY, I doubt I've made a better decision in my life by doing this.

'This' being:

  -stop working

  -pay a lot of money

  -take no income

  -do something new and extremely difficult


So when I say I thought I understood 'time is money', I did, but not as clearly
as I do now.

The rest of my life is just now beginning.  I'm learning Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and how to learn more and fend for myself.  Our instructor Bryce has already
given us an invaluable experience, and I am certain, I've never spent money more wisely.
